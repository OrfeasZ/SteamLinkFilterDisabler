# Steam - Link Filter Disabler

This is a small program that aims to disable Steam's 'malicious' link checks. 
This includes both the in-client check (which causes delays in opening links), and the browser link screen. 

----------

## Usage

You can find compiled and packaged binaries (along with debug symbols) in the [Releases][1] section. 
The only requirement to running the pre-built binaries is having the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable package][2] installed.

To use the app, simply run it as an administrator and wait while it patches Steam.
You have to be logged in in order for this to work, since the target module (friendsui.dll) is only loaded after a successful login.

You will have to re-patch Steam every time you launch it, since this is a simple in-memory patch.
After Steam is patched, you should be able to click on any link sent on chat and have it open instantly!

The following launch flags are currently available:

| Flag          | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **--retry**   | Forces the app to automatically retry patching upon failure.                                     |
| **--silent**  | Launches the app in silent mode, disabling the requirement for user input (also forces --retry). |

## Building

Visual Studio 2013 project files are included. 

The project is currently set to build with the **MSVC100** compiler (VS 2010) for compatibility reasons.
However, any compiler should work.

To build, simply open **LinkFilterDisabler.sln** in Visual Studio and build.
No external dependencies are needed.
