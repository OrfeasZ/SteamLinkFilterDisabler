# Steam - Link Filter Disabler

This is a small program that aims to disable Steam's 'malicious' link checks. 
This includes both the in-client check (which causes delays in opening links), and the browser link screen. 

----------

## Usage

To use it, simply run it as an administrator and wait while it patches Steam.

You will have to re-patch Steam every time you launch it, since this is a simple in-memory patch.

After Steam is patched, you should be able to click on any link sent on chat and have it open instantly!

There are two launch flags available:

| **--retry**  	| Launches the app in silent mode, disabling the requirement for user input (also forces --retry). 	|
|----------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| **--silent** 	| Launches the app in silent mode, disabling the requirement for user input (also forces --retry). 	|
