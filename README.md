# Steam - Link Filter Disabler

This is a small program that aims to disable Steam's 'malicious' link checks. 
To use it, simply run it as an administrator and wait while it patches Steam.

You will have to re-patch Steam every time you launch it, since this is a simple in-memory patch.

After Steam is patched, you should be able to click on any link sent on chat and have it open instantly!
